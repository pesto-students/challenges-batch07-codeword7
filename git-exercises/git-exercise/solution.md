# Git Excercise insights

I understood the GIT under the hood how it works, and stores the data/file. Although i knew branching almost fimilar with these concepts but i definetly learnt STASHING, it's really helpful for shipping software till previous working version commands like 'git stash', 'git stash list', 'git stash pop', 'git stash apply/ stash{}', 'git stash drop'. I enjoyed them the most!
